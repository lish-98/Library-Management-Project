This code is a two way accessible process by both the librarian and the student. The student can either return a book or issue a new one.
However, the librarian can perform multiple funtions as to add a new book in the system, remove a book from the system, edit books or their details and view issued books. We've used certain Software Management Methodoligies such as the Waterfall Method. We divided the project into smaller phases and all chunks were equally divided among the all group members according to their convenience and areas of interest. Hence, together with the joint efforts of all members and orderwise following of the cycle, we have been able to create this piece of code.
This console based application has a very easily readable and understandalble code. Upon running it would give you two option to choose from i.e. if you are a student or the librarian followed by their account details and queries respectively.
